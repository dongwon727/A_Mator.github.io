        "MoE-PEFT is an open-source *LLMOps* framework built on [m-LoRA](https://github.com/TUDB-Labs/mLoRA). It is designed for high-throughput fine-tuning, evaluation, and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) using techniques such as MoE + Others (like LoRA, DoRA). Key features of MoE-PEFT include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Concurrent fine-tuning, evaluation, and inference of multiple adapters with a shared pre-trained model.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **MoE PEFT** optimization, mainly for [MixLoRA](https://github.com/TUDB-Labs/MixLoRA) and other MoLE implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Support for multiple PEFT algorithms and various pre-trained models.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Seamless integration with the [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co) ecosystem.\n",
